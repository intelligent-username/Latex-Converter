# Convert Google Docs, Microsoft Word, HTML, and more to LaTeX

![Image](./image.jpg)

## LaTeX is very tedious to write in. I wrote this program so I can write the main body of my documents in a What-you-see-is-what-you-get environment (like Google Docs)

## Then, I can easily convert to LaTeX, and add the parts that require more attention (like formulas) manually

### This program will save time by

#### - Reducing the amount of time required to write in LaTeX

#### - Reducing the amount of time required to learn LaTeX

### Most useful for those who constantly need to write in LaTeX or those who are new

## Make sure you have the required files to run this program. They are listed in the requirements.txt file

### Currently Supports

- Google Docs (.docx)
- Microsoft Word (.doc, .docx)
- Markdown (.md)
- HTML (.html)
- Plain text (.txt)
- Rich text format (.rtf) (this one might break)

You need to have the Python programming language (version 3.1 or later (I use 3.11.7)) installed.
Once you have Python, the required libraries can be downloaded by typing:

```python
        pip install -r requirements.txt
```

in the command line/terminal

Then run the file by typing "python main.py" in the command line/terminal.

The program will ask you to input the name of the file you want to convert. This file needs to be in the same directory as the main.py file (i.e. in the Latex-Converter folder).

Make sure you include the file extension (like .docs or .txt), because the program needs this information.
